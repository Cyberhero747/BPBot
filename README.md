#BPBot - A helpful IRC robot on Rizon's #fit channel
====================================================

##What is it?
=============
BPBot is an IRC bot written in Python mainly as a learning exercise. It is mainly for
usage in Rizon's #fit channel, but many of the modules it contains are not fitness-specific

##How do I use it?
==================
* Download the repo
* Open config.py and fill in the necessary values
	* Set SSL boolean to 'True' and change the port accordingly if you wish to use an SSL connection
	Enter a valid server address
    ```server = 'server address'```
    Enter your desired channel name (multiple channel support coming soon...)
    ```chan = '#channel name'```
    Enter your port number (ensure you have a valid SSL port if SSL is True!)
    ```port = [port number]```
    Enter the nickname you wish BPBot to take
    ```nick = 'Nickname'```
    If have registered the nickname for BPBot on your server, enter the password here
    ```password = 'password'```
    Set SSL to True if you are using an SSL port, otherwise set to False
    ```SSL = [True/False]```

* Run BPBot.py and enjoy!
